<h1> Cormorant Garamond </h1>
  <p> Cormorant is a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann. The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual
  styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold
  , and Bold.) Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. 
  While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for 
  the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results 
  for a general impression. </p>
